Healthcare Products Data Analysis on Amazon website

This project consists of two Python scripts: one for web scraping using Selenium and another for data analysis using Streamlit.

Installation Instructions:

Selenium for Web Scraping (Python script - 'WebScraping_Selenium.ipynb' file)

1. Selenium Installation:
   
   pip install selenium
   
2. WebDriver (ChromeDriver):
   - Download ChromeDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and place it in your working directory.
   - Update the path variable in the web scraping script (ipynb file) with the path to your ChromeDriver.

Data Analysis Dependencies (Python script - 'DataAnalysis_Streamlit.py' file)

1. Streamlit Installation:
   
   pip install streamlit
   
2. Other Data Analysis Libraries:
   
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn wordcloud scipy
   

Running the Scripts:

Web Scraping (Selenium):
1. Open the ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially.
3. Provide a product to search when prompted.
4. The scraped data will be saved as product_list.xlsx.

Data Analysis (Streamlit):
1. Run the Streamlit file using the following command in your terminal:
   
   streamlit run <filename.py>
   
   Replace <filename.py> with the name of the Python file (DataAnalysis_Streamlit.py) for data analysis.
2. Access the Streamlit app through your browser for extensive Data Visualizations.
